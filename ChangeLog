ChangeLog
=========

11/22/2013
Changed package names
Deleted textview that used to be on the top.
Fixed friction
Changed `Point sprite2` to track the center of the sprite instead of the top left corner. Note: this broke the current collision detection system, and the sprite can now spawn halfway off screen.
